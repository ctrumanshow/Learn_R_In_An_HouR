So alright, you know how how to assign a variable. Let's really start cooking. This time we're going to learn factors and functions, two of the most useful tools in the R programmer's toolkit. First up, we'll tackle factors. Let me introduce you to a very useful feature of R. If you need to use a new function, but you're not sure how or what it is, you can ask R! Try it:

```{r}

?factor()

```

If you run ?function(), the 'Help' window will show what that function is - it gives a description, syntax and all the arguments needed. Before we look at it, when might you need a function? In the R in an HR repository, you'll find a file called 'Sequencing.xlsx. We're going to import it. So download it - and remember, to import a file, you need to be in the same directory as the file. For directory options:<br>
```{r}

getwd() # This gives you your current working directory

# setwd() # You can set the directory using this command - just put the full address of your diretory in here in quotes
# Like this: setwd('C:/Users/This/Is/An/Example') 

```

So let's import our data.

```{r}
library(readr)
Sequencing <- read_csv('Sequencing.csv')

```


Let's have a look at the data. 

```{r}

head(Sequencing)
```

This is a table of common mutations at certain amino acids positions. Let's say it came from RNA seq data - or, if you're not a scientist, you can just stick to it being genomic mutations! We imported using tidyverse, so it's in tibble form. Under each header, you can see what the data types are. Sometimes R assumes the wrong data type, so let's check. Both string columns are characters, that's fine. The 'Position' column says <dbl>. What is that?

```{r}

class(Sequencing$Position)

```

If we check the class, it says numeric. Look at this diagram of how data types encompass each other in R:

![Data types in R](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1d1b4e1cf0dc5f6e80f621b0225354b0addb9578/6ee1c/diagrams/data-structures-overview.png)


Numeric data is anything which is either an Integer or a Double. We briefly mentioned integers earlier - they are whole numbers. Doubles are double-precision floating point number, meaning they have more numbers after the decimal point. R usually converts to numeric for you, whenever appropriate. These classes seem appropriate, so we'll stick with them. 
```{r}
Sequencing2 <- read.delim('Sequencing.csv')

```
This table is only 6 rows, for simplicity, but often when working with data we'll be sifting through tables with thousands of entries. What if we want to sort through a column? One way to do this is by using factors. What are factors? Take initiative:

```{r}

?factor

```

Let's just use the function and see what happens. The help window should tell you that  takes an input argument ('x'), which is a vector of data. Since our whole dataset is a matrix, let's take a vector to use - a single column.

```{R}
factored_mutations <- factor(Sequencing$Mutation)
class(factored_mutations)
factored_mutations
```

Having gone through the factor() function, our vector is now of class factor. R returns the data, and importantly, outputs *levels.*
